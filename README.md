# ðŸ“ˆNasdaq Stocks

This is a stock market app designed to let users search for and view stocks listed on the NASDAQ exchange. Built with React and TypeScript, the app features seamless searching, infinite scrolling for stock data, and a splash screen that adds a polished experience.

## Main Features

- **Live Search:** Users can search for specific stocks by typing in the search bar. The search function triggers as users type, showing results in real-time.
- **Infinite Scrolling:** Stocks are loaded dynamically when users scroll, preventing page reloads and enhancing performance.
- **Search and Existing Data Switching:** Users can switch between searching for stocks and viewing previously loaded data without losing context.
- **Error Handling:** The app includes error handling to account for issues such as rate-limiting from the API.
- **Cache API Responses:** Redundant requests are avoided by caching API responses, improving performance and reducing unnecessary calls.
- **Splash Screen:** The app displays a splash screen with the Nasdaq logo centered on the screen and the developerâ€™s name at the bottom.
- **Responsive and Clean UI:** The appâ€™s interface is designed to be clean, responsive, and easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices.
